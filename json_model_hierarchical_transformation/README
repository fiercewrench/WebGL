This is a readme file for lab 04.

move light around the scheme in the world space:
up arrow - light move up
down arrow - light move down
left arrow - light move left
right arrow - light move right
PgUp - light move toward objects
PgDown - light move away from objects

move objects:
choose objects by clicking the button:
1. all - house, men and sphere
2. men and sphere
3. sphere

press keys to let the chosen objects roaming around in the viewport:
w - objects move towards camera
s - objects move away from camera
a - objects move left
d - objects move right
q - objects move up
z - objects move down

press keys to specify the camera rotation mode (the default camera rotation mode is yaw)
p - pitch
y - yaw
r - roll

click on the viewport, move the mouse and then release to specify the angle of the camera rotation

In the Phong Lightning, I set viewing position as the camera position so the specular light spot will change when rotating the camera.

The complex model I used is from the Internet:
