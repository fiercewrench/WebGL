This is a readme file for lab 5.


move light around the scheme in the world space:
up arrow - light move up
down arrow - light move down
left arrow - light move left
right arrow - light move right
PgUp - light move toward objects
PgDown - light move away from objects

move objects:
choose objects by clicking the button:
1. all - house, men and sphere
2. sphere and rectangle
3. rectangle

press keys to let the chosen objects roaming around in the viewport (local movement under the automatic rotation):
w - objects move towards camera
s - objects move away from camera
a - objects move left
d - objects move right
q - objects move up
z - objects move down

press keys to specify the camera rotation mode (the default camera rotation mode is yaw)
p - pitch
y - yaw
r - roll

Choose Texture, Bump mapping and Geometry by clicking button.

Redraw is also enabled by button.

click on the viewport, move the mouse and then release to specify the angle of the camera rotation

In the Phong Lightning, I set viewing position as the camera position so the specular light spot will change when rotating the camera.
